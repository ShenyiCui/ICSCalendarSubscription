# ICSCalendarSubscription
Node JS API, that allows people to push requests to generate online subscription calendars.

Currently, this API is only developed as an addon to DCBBookings. Allowing users to create and maintain personal and room subscription calendars. Though the code is designed to be extensible and modular. Allowing me to go back and utilize this API for different project in the future that may require a subscription calendar.
